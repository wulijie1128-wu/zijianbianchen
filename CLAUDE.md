# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Directory Structure

This is a Windows system directory (D:\) containing personal files, applications, and system folders rather than a specific development codebase. The directory includes:

- Various application folders (WeChat, Git, QQMusicCache, etc.)
- Personal files and downloads
- System folders (Program Files, ProgramData, etc.)
- Media files and documents

## Working in This Directory

Since this is not a traditional development project, consider the following when working here:

- This directory serves as a general storage location for applications and personal files
- Any development work would likely be in subdirectories or separate project folders
- Be cautious when making changes as this appears to be a system drive with important applications

## Notes

- No package.json, Cargo.toml, or other project configuration files found
- No git repositories detected in the current directory
- Consider navigating to a specific project directory if development work is intended
